    <div class="space-y-4 text-base md:text-lg text-whisper/90 leading-relaxed">
      <p><strong>modsuav is a workshop for digital freedom.</strong><br>
      We build tools that cut noise, clarify rhythm, and amplify flow — for designers, coders, and quiet rebels shaping the future by feel.</p>

      <p>Born from the tension between soul and software, modsuav isn’t a brand.<br>
      It’s a frequency. A set of utilities disguised as plugins.<br>
      Every tool we ship is built to remove friction, restore presence, and unlock clean control in the chaos of modern work.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-2 text-whisper/70">
        <li>minimal surfaces with maximal intention.</li>
        <li>interfaces that listen as much as they do.</li>
        <li>code as poetry, function as resistance.</li>
        <li>design that disappears once it delivers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>modsuav isn’t here to shout.</strong><br>
      It hums — like a well-rigged console. Just enough to hold you. Then out of the way.</p>

      <p class="text-suav">✶ welcome to the suite.</p>
